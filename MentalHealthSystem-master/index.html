        <p>Gervase story of overcoming the depression</p>
        <h3>Gervase struggled with depression twice in her life — both dealt with life and death.

            The first time was after her brother died, and the second was after she gave birth to a child, who is now 14 months old. Her brother’s death resonated with her entire family, but it really hit her hard. It was a sign that everything doesn’t last forever, she said.
            
            “The death of my brother changed how I prioritized people and events moving forward," Gervase wrote in a blog post. "I skimmed the fat from my life and made peace with my own demons."
            
            Then, she met Kevin, and the two had a child in 2013 — Aria Rose. Her daughter's birth also spawned depression for Gervase. It wasn’t so much having a daughter that made her depressed, but rather her having to re-evaluate who she was as a person. She could no longer be the partier she once was. She had to be responsible.
            
            But soon, little Aria helped Gervase rise up and overcome her depression.
            
            “Aria is my compass,” Gervase said in her blog post. “My ‘why.’ She is the reason I quit my sales job in February 2014 and went full time as a life coach. My intuition would not be quieted. And I deeply respect that little voice. My life's experiences have taught me a powerful lesson about the undervalued strength to be found in our raw human connections our relationships.”</h3>

        <p>Kate MacHugh story of overcoming depression</p>
        <h3>Kate MacHugh is now 25. She’s an author and clinician.

            But she only got to where she is now by overcoming depression as a teenager.
            
            MacHugh said she was “harassed, humiliated and cyberbullied,” during her teenage years, leading her to go from being a happy and vibrant youngster to someone more angry and “sullen.” Once she became a different person, she slowly slipped into the murky waters of depression.
            
            “It was the lowest I have ever felt in my life," she said to the National.
            
            But everything changed once she went to college. The peers who had put her down and bullied her within the walls of high school were long gone, and she could finally start focusing on what made her unique and special. Instilling confidence in herself was what got her past depression and on a path to success, she said.
            
            “I worked really hard to change the messages in my head,” MacHugh said. “I was led to believe that I was ugly, worthless, and disgusting. I internalized these messages and they became part of my identity. I began to tell myself that I was smart, loved and beautiful."</h3>

        <p>Jay Lowder story of overcoming depression</p>
        <h3>Jay Lowder overcame depression by finding God.

            He was 21 when everything went south. He was dumped, he lost his car and he found himself unemployed all at once. Things began to spiral out of control from there. Depression settled in and Lowder turned to the bottle as a source of escape.
            
            Things took a dark turn for Lowder. But with the help of his roommate, and religion, he overcome his struggle with depression.
            
            He was invited to an event hosted by a preacher, and it was there that he rediscovered his faith in God and religion. It has helped him grow his faith as an evangelist.
            
            He’s looking to spread that message now across the world.</h3>

        <p>Kim Hardy story of overcoming depression</p>
        <h3>Kim Hardy’s depression started when she lost her business.

            It was hard losing something she started from the ground up, and it hit her hard. She struggled with depression.
            
            But as a wife and mother, “I had so much to live for,” Hardy said.
            
            So now, Hardy is looking to help others beat depression. She recommends that people focus on themselves, acknowledge their depression and understand what battle they’ll have to wage. Then create a plan to beat it and understand it may be a bit of struggle. Lastly, she advises people to re-evaluate where they are in their own minds and how they think things are going in their life.
            
            “Sometimes that was only 15 minutes to 45 minutes,” Hardy said. “Whatever time I had, I made me a priority. I discovered I loved this time I had to reflect, process and pamper myself. Today, I am a thankful woman.”</h3>
